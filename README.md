# outdoor-adventures

The outdoor adventures is a website based in the South Africa for people who want to escape the city life. The website shows places and activities available to the users who are interested in finding this outdoor escape so that they are able to know what they are offered to do and where it takes place.

I created 3 pages of HTML and styled them, as well as animatede them using SASS and JavaScript. There is a home page, a contact page, and a gallery to view images of the different activities to be done outdoors.
